# Believe Support Service

Believe Support Services is a company that offers a wide variety of programs to support individuals with complex needs. Their programs include life skills training, recreation, and social groups, which help create a sense of community and give parents and caregivers a break. These programs are designed to encourage individuals to achieve their life goals and build independence. 

While working as a computer technician, I was assigned the task of updating their website. However, a lack of clear communication and alignment between the organization's vision and my understanding resulted in design and functionality issues. This emphasized the need for thorough discussions and documentation at the project's start, as well as multiple revisions to the website. Which I was able to give them enabling them to update the website to their needs.
